# VHDL-Greatest-Ones
This VHDL code implements a digital system that processes four 4-bit input values (a, b, c, d) and computes two outputs: the greatest value among the inputs (greatest) and a count of ones (ones) in the binary representation of the greatest value. The system operates in a clocked process with a reset signal.
